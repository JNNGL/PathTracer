> [!IMPORTANT]
> The shader **requires Iris 1.8.8+** to function properly. Using this shader with older Iris versions or other shader loaders will likely cause bugs or unexpected behaviour.

> [!WARNING]
> This is an offline renderer and **NOT a gameplay shader**. This means that you will have to stand still and wait for the noise to clear up to get a decent result. Rendering a single image might take anywhere from minutes to hours depending on your hardware and the scene complexity.
